<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">History of (AI) </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:20px;">	When did artificial intelligence’s research start and how?</h2>
	<p>Artificial intelligence was invented because of many ancient Greek myths about robots as well as automatons that were built by Chinese and Egyptian engineers. In addition to this, classical philosophers made attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. It was not until 1956 that the term artificial intelligence was invented at a conference at Dartmouth College. </p>

	<p>Like every invention as AI was starting to flourish and to achieve a being it faced several criticizing reports, so the government stopped funding it. As a result, an ‘AI winter’ happened from 1974 to 1980.</p>

	<p>In the 1980’s, the field of AI was revived by the British government and the Japanese after they had started funding it again. Throughout the period from 1987 to 1993 the AI field faced another 'AI winter’. </p>

<p>Despite this, the AI research started to pick up again in 1997. This was when a computer, IBM’s Deep Blue, was the first computer to beat a human in chess when it defeated a chess grandmaster called Garry Kasparov. Also, in the question-answering system 'Watson won the quiz show “Jeopardy!”’ from the computer giant in 2011 beat reigning champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.</p>
	<p>This year, the talking computer "chatbot" Eugene Goostman captured headlines for tricking judges into thinking he was real skin-and-blood human during a Turing test, a competition developed by British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950 as a way to assess whether a machine is intelligent.</p>
	<p>But the accomplishment has been controversial, with artificial intelligence experts saying that only a third of the judges were fooled, and pointing out that the bot was able to dodge some questions by claiming it was an adolescent who spoke English as a second language.</p>
